# Pin against a version

In software we often specify a version of a project to use. For example - `requests==1.2` - this says _"we want to use requests version 1.2"_.

For this guide we recommend the following: picking a specific version and working against it. Just like software; future versions of this guide could change, potentially causing conflicts with the styleguide in your project.

You can see the released versions [here](https://github.com/phalt/django-api-domains/releases) and by clicking on the tag icon you can view historical versions. The published version at [https://phalt.github.io/django-api-domains](https://phalt.github.io/django-api-domains) will always be the latest version.

# Be pragmatic

Don't blindly follow what other people have written down. Sometimes it might not be suitable for your own problem. Use this guide as inspiration and guidance, but make your own decisions with your team when you aren't satisfied with it.

# Wording in this guide

Sometimes this guide refers to the following areas in a domain: `interfaces`, `apis`, `services`, and `models`. You can assume any code examples are from the file name of the same area. E.g. - code examples under an `apis` heading is meant for the `apis.py` file.
